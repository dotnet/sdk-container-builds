### Special thanks

A big shout-out to [Daniel Kuschny](@danielku15) for his contributions to this release! Daniel investigated and solved some fundamental issues around to how we create archives to send to a local container daemon.

To start containerizing your projects, see our [Getting Started](http://github.com/dotnet/sdk-container-builds/blob/main/docs/GettingStarted.md) docs.
